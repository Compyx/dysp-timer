DYSP timing table generator
===========================

A simple routine to generate a cyle table for DYSP timing, by hand!

Use joystick in port 2 to play with the DYSP:
* Up/Down to select which sprites are displayed in the DYSP raster code, all
  256 possible combinations of sprites can be selected
* Left/Right to adjust the number of cycles to skip to keep the border open

The cycle table is located at $0d00-$0dff


Only published here to keep a copy handy when I may need bits of this code.
